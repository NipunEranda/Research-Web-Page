        <p>The following milestones are used to achieve the goal of developing the Smart Project system. The project
            will be
            evaluated out of 100 marks to be achieved at the end of the year. And out of the 100 marks different
            percentages are allocated for each milestone achievement. Team has met the deadlines and produced the

            <h4>Project Proposal</h4>
            <p>Project Proposal document is the initial document that demarcate the initial requirements of the project
                activities. These requirements could change over the time. Follow-up of a good project management plan
                is
                quite necessary to support the aggressive changes of the requirements. The use of methodologies and PMP
                are described under the proposal document as well.

                This is the first progress presentation after the project proposal. In this step, Evaluation panel will
                evaluate the project progress. The target completion for the first progress presentation is 50% from the
                overall project completion. Panel expect us to provide evidance of the progress and the future
                implementation ideas of the project.

                panel expect to provide evidance to confirm that the each student's progress is over 90%. At this stage,
                each research component should output an accurate result or results in order to prove that the project
                is at 90% completion.

                integrated into a single system in order to prove that the project is at the deployment phase. Project
                should be hosted in a cloud system or using any other solution. Panel expect to see the final results
                and the accuracy of each component with evidance. In addition to that, the camera-ready poster should be
                also be there to get an idea about the research for the audiance.</p>

                The oral exam (also oral test or viva voce) is a practice in many schools and disciplines, where an
                examiner poses questions to the student in spoken form. The student has to answer the question in such a
                way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the subject in order to pass the exam.
